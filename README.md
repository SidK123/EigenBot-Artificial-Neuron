# EigenBot-Artificial-Neuron
Implemented an artificial biological system using spiking neurons, synapses, and simulated axon delays. Used SystemVerilog and the Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA, and
performed Euler discretization on the coupled differential equations specified by the Izhikevich Neuron Model.
